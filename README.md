# inventoryUpkeep

I needed a project to test what i knew and what i could do. So i started this one. This project has a some goals

Inventory upkeep
  needs to keep track of inventory.
Show Inventory
  needs to display inventory.
Cash register/delete inventory.
  The back bone of this is based off a current company that uses paper inventory sheets 
  and an eraser to keep inventroy. and you have to memorize prices.
Localized
  This is the hardest. I wanted to build this application around the needs of the company i had in mind.
  I decided not to use a database because I wanted to cut down on the issues that could be possible and for it to be able to 
  function without internet. 
 
This is my first "big" program and it's not quite done yet. Feel free to take a peak or add suggestions.
